Hi, I am a highly analytical doctoral graduate skilled in using R and Python for data analysis, regression, and data visualization. In addition I have Basic familiarity with relational databases and REDCap. Currently I am developing my understanding of the inclusion of version control in the data analysis workflow to improve reproducibility and I am looking for opportunities which allow for continued learning and development.
