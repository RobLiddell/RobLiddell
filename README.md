- 👋 Hi, I’m @RobLiddell
- 👀 I’m interested in data science, coding, machine learning and puzzles. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning git, python, machine learning and SQL. While I already have a strong foundation in R I can always learn much more within the analytical field.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any project that gives me the opportunity to learn. Approaching coding always feels easier when their is a concrete goal.
